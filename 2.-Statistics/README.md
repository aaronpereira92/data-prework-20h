# Introduction to Statistics
The statistics challenge consists of completing the short lab contained in challenge.ipynb. This challenge is *required*.
To get started, open the notebook file in browser. Then, follow the step-by-step instructions to solve the challenge in the interactive coding environment.

## Deliverables
The files you need to submit are:
- The `.ipynb` files file of the challenge including the solutions.

## Submitting Your Work

If you are an enrolled student, **you are required to submit your solutions before your course starts**. 


If you have time and would like more practice, you may also complete the following challenge as well.



### Bonus Challenge
The statistics bonus challenge consists of completing the Data Science Math Skills course in Coursera, offered by Duke University.

Though data science is in the name, the course teaches the core math upon which both data science and data analytics are built. You'll learn about set theory, math notation, probability theory, etc. The expected duration of the course is 15 hours and you can enroll in it for free.

**Watch the lesson videos, read the recommended articles and when you feel ready, complete the practice exercises and quizes for each week. When you are done, take screenshots of all the solved exercises and save them.**
